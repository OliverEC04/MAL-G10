    "* Implement: loss function based on (R)MSE,\n",
    "* Implement: setting of the number of iterations and learning rate ($\\eta$) via parameters in the constructor (the signature of your `__init__` must include the named parameters `eta0` and `max_iter`),\n",
    "* (in a later exercise we will also add `tol`, `n_iter_no_change` and `verbose` to the constructor),\n",
    "* Implement: the batch-gradient decent algorithm (GD),\n",
    "* Implement: constant learning rate (maybe also adaptive learning rate if you are brave),\n",
    "* Implement: stochastic gradient descent (SGD),\n",
    "* Describe in text: epochs vs iterations,\n",

    "* test in via the smoke tests at the end of this Notebook,\n",
    "* testing it on MNIST data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following no-no's (WONT):\n",
    "\n",
    "* no learning graphs, no early stopping (we will do this in a later exercise),\n",
    "* no multi-linear regression,\n",
    "* no reuse of the Scikit-learn regressor,\n",
    "* no `C/C++` optimized implementation with a _thin_ Python interface (nifty, but out-of-scope for this cause),\n",
